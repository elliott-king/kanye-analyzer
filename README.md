# r/Kanye Wavyness analyzer
An ML project to learn what is 'wavy' - according to reddit.com/r/kanye.
[https://realtime.cannibaltaylor.com/](https://realtime.cannibaltaylor.com/)

## Inspiration
Users in the [kanye subreddit](reddit.com/r/kanye) use the term 'wavy' (or ðŸŒŠ) to refer to something positively. This is unified among most users, and it allows us to see what is frequently complimented. I started this project to practice fullstack (the webapp) as well as machine learning (the language processing).

## Wavyness in Real Time
The wavy feed will show the five most recent comments that include 'wavy' or ðŸŒŠ. For each of these, the model attempts to classify it. You can also manually classify a comment to help the model out!

Additionally, you can take a look at the overall breakdown of comments.

Note that the breakdown is only for comments that have been classified by humans.

## Project Structure

I used some simple ML (python's `nltk`) on the backend to try to guess what a comment is referring to, and classify it in to one of 10 categories (see `constants.py`). I am running a bare bones localhost server that answers questions about the data.

The NodeJS server handles two roles:
1. continually collect comments from the subreddit & add them to Mongo (using [redditSnooper](https://github.com/JuicyPasta/reddit-snooper))
2. serve the frontend
It connects to the python over localhost to label the data.

The frontend is located at [https://realtime.cannibaltaylor.com/](https://realtime.cannibaltaylor.com/). Here, you can see some recent comments, and what the classifier labeled them as. You can also classify them, to help out the classifier! There is also a statistics page, in which you can see the most common classifications.

The nodejs server is run with [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/). The python server is run with flask (see the server.py file for running instructions).

The server processes are running on a Digital Ocean droplet, with an NGINX reverse proxy.

## TODOS:
- Consider moving to python on the backend. (mostly done)

### High Priority:
- BACK UP MONGO

### Med Priority:
- In react-select for user classification, user should have a null option.
- Shuffle data before feeding into model.
- Retain mlp's vectorizer for use in classifying comments?
- Python server should be two servers! So they can run independently.
- Python server should restart upon code change.
- get_estimate in app.js has callback hell. Consider changing to request-promise-native?
- Better integrate python & node using rabbitMQ: https://medium.com/@HolmesLaurence/integrating-node-and-python-6b8454bfc272

### Low priority:
- Refactor comment extraction - just get all comments from mongo, check if contains 'category' after.
- Move mlp to seperate dir w/in nlp/
- nlp.py feature extractor should have a more useful error if a comment does not have a specific key.
- Consider graphing change in accuracy w/ more test data: run several times & randomize each time, graph changes
- Reinforce (on client and server) that data is JSON format
- style.css is being duplicated (incl. @ index.jsx, also copies w/ webpack.config)
- Move to PostgreSQL?
- consider splitting the website and scraper
    a) Redis to communicate?
    b) Postgres event notification
    c) Server-sent events: https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/#toc-js-api
