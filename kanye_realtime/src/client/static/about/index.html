            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>Users in <a href=reddit.com/r/kanye" target="_blank">r/kanye</a> use the term 'wavy' (or ðŸŒŠ) to refer to something positively. This is unified among most users, and it allows us to see what is frequently complimented.</p>
            <p>I started this project to practice fullstack (the webapp) as well as machine learning (the language processing).</p>
            <h3>Wavy feed</h3>
            <p>This will show the five most recent comments, as well as the guess that the ML model makes for each. Additionally, you can classify them yourself, which will help to improve the model.</p>
            <h3>Comment Breakdown</h3>
            <p>The categorization of all comments. The community is very positive towards one another!</p>
            <h3>Predicting comments</h3>
            <p>I hand-classified ~1000 comments, and created a simple ML model based on them. It makes guesses in real-time on the wavy feed page. I really appreciate when you classify a comment, as it will make the model better!</p>
            <p>It's accuracy is mediocre, but it is significantly better than a random guess (10%). The production model is a simple <a href="http://www.nltk.org/book/ch06.html">Naive Bayes Classifier</a>, although I have a <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/text-classification/">Multilayer Perceptron</a> that I may switch it with. You can see the code for them at my Github (below).</p>
            <h3>Categories</h3>
            <p>I took user comments containing the word 'wavy,' or containing ðŸŒŠ classified them as either <b>positive</b> or <b>negative</b>. Then, I classified them into one of the following categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>poster</b>: another poster on the subreddit</li>
                <li><b>op</b>: the original poster of the thread</li>
                <li><b>link</b>: the subject of the thread</li>
                <li><b>this_sub</b>: r/kanye as a whole (or all its users)</li>
                <li><b>Kanye</b>: the man himself</li>
                <li><b>external_person</b>: an external individual (other than Kanye)</li>
                <li><b>external_object</b>: an external object</li>
                <li><b>self</b>: the user posting the comment</li>
                <li><b>copypasta</b></li>
                <li><b>misc</b></li>
            </ul>
