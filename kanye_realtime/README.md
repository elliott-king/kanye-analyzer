#TODOS:

###High Priority:
- Show percents of comments that fill categories.
- Move off of http -> express.js (http not updated)

###Low priority:
- Name server file 'app.js'
- Move to PostgreSQL
- consider splitting the website and scraper
    a) Redis to communicate
    b) Postgres event notification
    c) Server-sent events: https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/#toc-js-api
