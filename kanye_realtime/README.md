#TODOS:

###High Priority:
- Show percents of comments that fill categories.
- Cache parts of the mongo_handler

###Low priority:
- Name server file 'app.js'
- Reinforce (on client and server) that data is JSON format
- style.css is being duplicated (incl. @ index.js, also copies w/ webpack.config)
- Move to PostgreSQL
- consider splitting the website and scraper
    a) Redis to communicate
    b) Postgres event notification
    c) Server-sent events: https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/#toc-js-api
